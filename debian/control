Description: Python library for Intel HEX files manipulations
 The Intel HEX file format is widely used in microprocessors and
 microcontrollers area (embedded systems etc) as the de facto standard for
 representation of code to be programmed into microelectronic devices.
 .
 This work implements an intelhex Python library to read, write, create from
 scratch and manipulate data from Intel HEX file format.
 .
 The distribution package also includes several convenience Python scripts,
 including “classic” hex2bin and bin2hex converters and more, those based on
 the library itself. Check the docs to know more.
